"I describe myself as a polite person who is simple in lifestyle as well in thoughts. I always stay calm and patient in life which helps me to analyze the situation in life. I have deep faith in god and always worship him. Presently I am pursuing CA and in future I want to establish my career in the same field. My main aim is to be successful and to attain a reputed position in life. My mother is a homemaker and father is a business man. I have a brother who is currently pursuing Law from Amity University.
In my school I was a bright student of my class and I have received various appreciations from my teachers. After completing my school I did B Com from Delhi University. There are very few people in my life who are my best friends and I can expect them to be there with me in my good and bad times. They always support me and listen to me carefully. Generally I spend my time watching movies, TV and travelling to new places with them. Further, I like listening to music of my choice and reading interesting books.","I want a simple man to be my husband who can understand me and my way of looking at life. He should be a family oriented person and must respect my family. This way he will receive respect from me towards him and his family.
I would prefer a man from Delhi/NCR region and he should be aged between 25-27 years with a healthy body structure. He can be from any profession; I just want him to be well settled so that in future after marriage both of us can lead a happy life. His family background should be good and they must be known in the society as well mannered people. It is very necessary for my parents to be sure about his family as they want me to enter a civilized family. As I am an emotional persona and cannot hold on to things for a longer period of time so I expect my husband to be understanding enough to make me overcome this problem. I will fill his life with love if he is like the one I am looking for.
